            <strong>Technical translation</strong> refers to the specialized translation of materials related to scientific,
            technological, or engineering fields. It involves the use of domain-specific terminology and requires translators
            with in-depth subject matter expertise — not just language skills.
          </p>

          <p>
            This kind of translation covers a broad range of content, including scientific research papers, medical articles,
            engineering documents, software manuals, technical datasheets, and product specifications.
          </p>

          <p>
            At one end of the spectrum, you have complex research articles from scientific or medical journals, which demand
            translators with advanced academic knowledge in the respective field. On the other end, documents like product
            manuals or datasheets require familiarity with industry-specific terms and functional clarity, even if deep technical
            knowledge isn’t always needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            From the client’s perspective, <strong>technical translation typically costs more and takes longer</strong> than
            general or business translation. That’s because:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-5">
            <li>It demands high subject-matter expertise</li>
            <li>Fewer qualified translators are available in specialized language pairs</li>
            <li>Terminology must be accurate, consistent, and localized</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            For example, translating medical articles from Japanese to English is costlier due to high demand and the limited
            pool of translators with both medical and linguistic proficiency.
          </p>

          <p>
            Technical translation can also include specialized branches like <em>automotive translation</em>, <em>aerospace manuals</em>,
            <em>IT documentation</em>, and more.
