          <p>
            Legal translation refers to the translation of any document used within a legal context.
            Since legal documents are typically required to be submitted in the official language of
            a given jurisdiction, this service can include a wide range of texts — such as witness
            statements, legal rulings, case laws, patents, contracts, financial records, and identity documents.
          </p>
          <p>
            A wide variety of additional content may also require legal translation, depending on its relevance to legal proceedings.
            For instance, the last will and testament of an expatriate might need to be translated into the official language
            of the country where they passed away, especially when required by a probate lawyer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the complexity of legal language and the high stakes involved, legal translation must be handled by specialists.
            Errors — especially in contracts — can lead to serious financial and legal consequences. Legal translators must have
            a firm grasp of terminology, ethical obligations, and deadlines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Requirements for legal translators vary by country. Some nations offer specialized degrees in Legal and Business Translation.
            Countries such as Argentina and Brazil mandate the use of state-certified public translators. Others — including Spain,
            Sweden, and The Netherlands — require legal translators to take oaths and be centrally regulated (commonly known as sworn translation).
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, some jurisdictions require legal translations to be notarized or certified by authorized legal professionals.
          </p>
          <p>
            To ensure quality, you should consider a translator’s certifications, memberships in professional associations,
            and experience with the specific language pair and legal domain. Although legal translation may never be “perfect” in the strictest sense,
            a translator’s understanding of the legal system in both source and target countries is crucial for a reliable outcome.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Juridical Translation</h2>
          <p>
            Juridical translation can be understood in two ways. On one hand, it refers to the translation of legal documents
            such as contracts, certificates, and charters. On the other, it encompasses legally certified translations — often
            called notarized translations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both forms require a high level of responsibility and precision in transferring the meaning of the original text
            into another language. As legal professionals often say, <em>“Verba volant, scripta manent”</em> —
            spoken words fade, but written words remain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Written documentation forms the foundation for legal clarity, enforceability, and trust — particularly in business relations.
            If your business activities involve multiple languages and jurisdictions, accurate juridical translation becomes essential.
          </p>
          <p>
            We offer fast and professional translation of legal contracts that meet all quality standards. This includes:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-5">
            <li>Understanding legal terminology</li>
            <li>Familiarity with contract structures</li>
            <li>Awareness of local business norms and practices</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We not only translate contracts, but also assist in adapting them to fit local legal contexts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, we have built an extensive database of templates for customs forms, invoices, packing lists, and other
            regulatory documents — enabling us to process even urgent or rare-language translation requests quickly and reliably.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of our work includes layout and formatting support, because we understand that translation isn’t just about language —
            it’s about helping you maintain clarity and consistency in all your official communications.
