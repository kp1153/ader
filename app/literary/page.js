            <strong>Literary translation</strong> involves the rendering of creative and artistic texts such as novels, poems,
            plays, essays, biographies, and literary criticism from one language into another. Unlike technical or legal
            translation, this process requires not just accuracy, but also a deep understanding of tone, emotion, cultural
            nuances, and artistic expression.

          <p>
            The goal of literary translation is to preserve the original writer&apos;s voice, rhythm, and intent while making the
            content accessible and engaging to a new audience. This means a translator must strike a delicate balance — 
            staying true to the meaning of the original, while also adapting style and idioms to fit the target language
            naturally.

          <p>
            This kind of translation is particularly challenging because literal word-for-word translation rarely works in
            literature. Instead, translators must understand subtext, symbolism, narrative flow, and the emotional weight of
            words.
