            <strong>Medical translation</strong> refers to the accurate and compliant translation of documents, software,
            packaging, and educational content related to the pharmaceutical, medical device, and healthcare industries. It includes
            clinical research documentation, product labeling, regulatory submissions, patient information, and medical training materials.
          </p>

          <p>
            In most countries, it is a legal requirement to translate all documentation and labeling associated with pharmaceuticals
            and medical devices into the national language. This ensures that patients, healthcare providers, and regulatory bodies
            can understand and use the information safely and effectively.
          </p>

          <p>
            Due to the highly technical and regulated nature of medical content, medical translation requires not only linguistic
            expertise but also subject-matter knowledge and industry-specific training.
          </p>

          <p>The process typically includes the following steps:</p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>Text extraction from the original format</li>
            <li>Translation by a medically trained professional</li>
            <li>Editing by a second linguist for terminology compliance</li>
            <li>Desktop publishing to match the original layout (Word, web, or e-learning)</li>
            <li>Proofreading for formatting, punctuation, and layout integrity</li>
            <li>In-country review by a native-speaking medical expert</li>
          </ul>
